## pushSwap - 42

# Description:
Push Swap is an algorithmic challenge focused on sorting data using two stacks and a limited set of operations. The goal is to sort a stack of integers in ascending order using the minimum possible number of moves. This project emphasizes algorithm optimization and complexity analysis. We nned to implement a program that calculates and outputs the most efficient sequence of stack operations (push, swap, rotate) to achieve a sorted state.

# Context:
Part of 42 Common Core.

# Main Technologies / Skills Used:

- **Programming Languages:** C
- **Algorithm Design & Implementation:** Developing efficient sorting strategies 
- **Data Structure Manipulation:** Working with stacks, implementing push, pop, rotate, and swap operations
- **Memory Management:** Efficient allocation and deallocation of stack structures
- **Input Validation:** Parsing and validating integer arguments, handling duplicates and errors
- **Edge Case Handling:** Managing various input sizes and data arrangements
